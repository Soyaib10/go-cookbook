Best Practices
Use sync.Mutex for critical sections where both read and write access must be safe.
Prefer sync.RWMutex for data structures where reads significantly outnumber writes, to allow parallel reads.
Consider using sync.Map for highly concurrent scenarios, but be aware that its performance might not always be better than a map with explicit locking.

Common Pitfalls
Forgetting to unlock a Mutex or RWMutex when a function returns early can lead to deadlocks.
Using sync.Map for all scenarios indiscriminately, as it may not always provide the best performance due to increased operational overhead.
Incorrectly assuming map is safe for concurrent read/writes without synchronization, which leads to subtle race conditions.
