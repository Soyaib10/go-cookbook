Best Practices
Use pointers for large structs or when functions need to modify the original data.
Always check pointer validity and handle nil pointers to prevent runtime panics.
Consider using interfaces if the exact data type isn't necessary, lowering coupling.


Common Pitfalls
Dereferencing a nil pointer leads to runtime panic; always ensure pointers are initialized.
Avoid excessive use of pointers that can complicate simple value-based data structures.
Incorrectly assuming addresses of variables remain constant; they might change as programs scale.
