Best Practices
Keep interfaces small and focused.
Use interface names that reflect what they do, often by using verbs like Reader, Writer, or Formatter.
Utilize type assertion only when necessary, and handle cases where it might fail gracefully.


Common Pitfalls
Avoid large interfaces; they make code less flexible and harder to test.
Don't mix interface and concrete type methods within the same implementation scope.
For beginners, understanding error messages related to interface satisfaction can be non-intuitive. Carefully match method signatures.
