Best Practices
Always close channels from the sender's side.
Use buffered channels only when performance benefits outweigh increased complexity.
Prefer using the select statement for cases where multiple channel operations may block.
Avoid using channels as mutexes; they are meant for communication, not locking.


Common Pitfalls
Leaving a channel open when it's no longer needed can lead to resource leaks or deadlocks.
Overusing buffered channels can result in unexpected memory consumption.
Forgetting to check for closed channels can lead to receiving zero values, causing logic errors.
