Best Practices
Use buffered channels to avoid blocking sends when the number of jobs is small compared to the number of workers.
Use a sync.WaitGroup to ensure all workers complete their tasks before closing the results channel.
Ensure proper closing of the jobs channel once all jobs have been dispatched.
Consider error handling mechanisms for failed tasks within workers.
Dynamically adjust the number of workers based on available system resources and/or limits (for example, when doing logs of parallel requests).


Common Pitfalls
Forgetting to close the jobs channel, leading to deadlock.
Not using a sync.WaitGroup, making it harder to coordinate the completion of all tasks.
Starting too many goroutines, which might lead to resource exhaustion.
Blocking on results channel reading due to an incorrect number of expected results.
Not handling errors inside worker function properly, which can make debugging difficult.
