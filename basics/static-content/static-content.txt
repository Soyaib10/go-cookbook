Best Practices
Serve static content from a dedicated directory to avoid exposing unintended files.
Use http.StripPrefix judiciously to serve files correctly from nested directories.
Set proper cache headers for static files to improve client-side performance.
Secure the server by limiting the file types served, if necessary.


Common Pitfalls
Incorrect directory paths can result in 404 Not Found errors; ensure the file paths specified match the directory layout.
Failing to use http.StripPrefix when serving from a subdirectory can result in mismatch errors.
Allowing public access to sensitive files by placing them in the same directory as static content.
