Best Practices
Use TAR for Unix/Linux environments and ZIP for cross-platform compatibility.
Validate file paths during extraction to prevent directory traversal attacks.
Use compression (zip.Deflate) for better space efficiency in ZIP archives.


Common Pitfalls
Not handling directory creation during extraction, leading to failed file creation.
Forgetting to close archive writers, which may result in incomplete archives.
Not sanitizing file paths during extraction, creating security vulnerabilities.
Performance Tips
Use buffered I/O for large files to improve archive creation and extraction speed.
Consider parallel processing for multiple independent files in large archives.
Choose appropriate compression levels based on the trade-off between speed and size.
Pre-allocate buffers for I/O operations when processing many files.
