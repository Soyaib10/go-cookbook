Best Practices
Provide user-friendly error messages and application usage information.
Keep commands modular and use subcommands for better organization.
Make use of external libraries when advanced features are necessary, but keep dependencies minimal.


Common Pitfalls
Not validating user inputs properly, leading to potential runtime errors.
Ignoring return values or errors, which might cause unhandled exceptions when the application runs.
Poor command organization leading to a confusing and non-intuitive CLI.
